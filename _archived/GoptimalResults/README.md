## Scripts for G optimal detection

For Lucia:

The `go_sim_hpc.py` is the template file of doing brain simulation with SJ3D local model

The `main.py` file is the script I used to compute the G optimal

`read_corrMatrix.py` and `read_mat.py` are two easy tools to calculate functional connectivity and read mat file (empirical functional connectivity data).

Feel free to ask me anything!
